<upcase>Wikipedia</upcase>[b] is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a <upcase>community of volunteers</upcase>, known as <upcase>Wikipedians</upcase>, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Founded by <upcase>Jimmy Wales</upcase> and <upcase>Larry Sanger</upcase> on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted <upcase>since 2003</upcase> by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.[3] Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.[4][5]

Initially available only in English, <upcase>Wikipedia</upcase> now exists in more than <upcase>300 languages</upcase>. The English Wikipedia, with over 6 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 64 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits <upcase>per month</upcase> (about 5 edits per second on average) as of April 2024.[W 1] As of November 2024, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic was from the United States, followed by Japan at 6.2%, the United Kingdom at 5.6%, Russia at 5.0%, Germany at 4.8%, and the remaining 53.3% split among other countries.[6]

<upcase>Wikipedia</upcase> has been praised for enabling the <upcase>democratization of knowledge, its extensive coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[7][8] Although Wikipedia's volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics, the encyclopedia has been criticized for systemic bias, such as a gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).[9][10] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward,[4][11][12] while becoming an important fact-checking site</upcase>.[13][14] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information about <upcase>those</upcase> events.
